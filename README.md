# About

This is a game where the player attempts to guess a specific number between 1 and 100 in as few tries as possible. Can you find a technique that works the best?

# How To Play

After launching the python file in your preferred method, enter any number between 1 and 100 and press enter to guess. The program will tell you if your guess was too high or too low, after which you can adjust accordingly
and guess again. Once you guess the correct number, the program will tell you how many guesses it took. After which you may hit 'Enter' to exit the program.

### Note

Only integers from 1 to 100 are valid guesses. Invalid guesses will result in the program reminding you what qualifies as a valid guess. Any invalid guesses entered will not go against your total number of guesses.
